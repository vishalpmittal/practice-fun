* SLI, SLO, KTLO, KPI, Uptime
* Incident
* Service Discovery
* Heartbeat Maintainance

* Service Level Indicator (SLI): a carefully defined quantitative measure of

  some aspect of the level of service that is provided.eg: the
  success rate of requests to a particular REST endpoint is the SLI.

* Service Level Objective (SLO): a target value or range of values for a

  service level that is measured by an SLI.eg: the minumum
  success rate of requests to a particular endpoint of a service is the SLO
  for that endpoint.

* Incident: an event that begins when the `SLI<SLO` and ends when `SLI>=SLO` 

* ATTR - Average Time To Repair
* MTTR - Mean Time To Repair
