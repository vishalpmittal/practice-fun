* SDLC: Software Development Lifecycle
  + Requirement Analysis
  + Design
  + Development
  + Testing
  + Deployment/Release
  + Maintenance

* STAR: Situation Task Action Result
* SMART: Specific Measurable Attainable Relevant Time-based
* RICE: Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort (RIC/E = feature or functionality)
* OKR (Objectives and Key Results):
  + OKRs are an effective goal-setting and leadership tool for communicating what you want 
    to accomplish and what milestones you’ll need to meet in order to accomplish it.
  + Usually 5 OKRs created yearly/quarterly
  + Types:
    - Committed OKR
    - Aspirational OKR (aka moonshot, stretch goals)
    - Learning OKR
  + OKR vs. KPI: 
    OKRs are more than just KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). They’re measures for change, whereas KPIs are measures of health.
  + Benefits: Focus, Alignment, Commitment, Tracking, Stretching
