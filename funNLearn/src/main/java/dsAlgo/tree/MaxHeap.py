    Design MaxHeap
    -  Its a datastructure where the root node is always the highest one. 
    -  A parent node is always bigger than the child nodes
    
    -  Eg. priority queue
    PriorityQueue<Integer> pqueue = new PriorityQueue<Integer> (k, Collections.reverseOrder());

    In this priority queue highest number will be the first element always. So if the size of the queue is K and we keep inserting elements to it, we can get the kth smallest element by finding out the first element in the queue at the end.
