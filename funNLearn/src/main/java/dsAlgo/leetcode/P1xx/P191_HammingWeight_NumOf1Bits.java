	 * An Integer in Java has 32 bits, e.g. 00101000011110010100001000011010. To
	 * count the 1s in the Integer representation with put the input int n in bit
	 * AND with 1 (that is represented as 00000000000000000000000000000001, and if
	 * this operation result is 1, that means that the last bit of the input integer
	 * is 1. Thus we add it to the 1s count. ones = ones + (n & 1);
	 * 
	 * Then we shift the input Integer by one on the right, to check for the next
	 * bit. n = n>>>1;
	 * 
	 * We need to use bit shifting unsigned operation >>> (while >> depends on sign
	 * extension)
	 * 
	 * We keep doing this until the input Integer is 0. In Java we need to put
	 * attention on the fact that the maximum integer is 2147483647. Integer type in
	 * Java is signed and there is no unsigned int. So the input 2147483648 is
	 * represented in Java as -2147483648 (in java int type has a cyclic
	 * representation, that means Integer.MAXVALUE+1==Integer.MINVALUE). This force
	 * us to use n!=0 in the while condition and we cannot use n>0 because the input
	 * 2147483648 would correspond to -2147483648 in java and the code would not
	 * enter the while if the condition is n>0 for n=2147483648.
