"""
    tag: thread, parallel

    A barrier is a simple synchronization primitive which can be used by different 
    threads to wait for each other. Each thread tries to pass a barrier by calling 
    the wait() method, which will block until all of threads have made that call. 
    As soon as that happens, the threads are released simultaneously.

    It's like ready,get set, go in a race. Just wait until all the players are ready.
