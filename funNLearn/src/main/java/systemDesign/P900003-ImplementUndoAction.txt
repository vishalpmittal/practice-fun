How would you implement Undo action in text/word processors. 

======================
Questions to ask
======================
Q: Any maximum number of undo's we are providing or is it infinite for one application opening. 
Q: Do we support undo on muliple reopen's of the application?

Solution
===========
Use a stack for each operation performed. Push for every operation performed and pop for every undo. 

If maximum number of undo reaches copy the whole stack into another stack but the first added operation.
then add the latest operation.

This might be an costly operation so to prevent that a custom stack class 
might be used that has push, pop and remove(0) methods.

For that a linked list might be used. 
push is insert at head. 
pop is remove from head. 
remove(0) is remove from tail.
