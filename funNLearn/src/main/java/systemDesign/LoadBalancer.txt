 -  A load balancer is a device that acts as a reverse proxy and distributes 
    network or application traffic across a number of servers. 
 
 -  Load balancers are used to increase capacity (concurrent users) and reliability 
    of applications. 
    They improve the overall performance of applications by decreasing the burden on servers associated with managing and maintaining application and network sessions, as well as by performing application-specific tasks.

 -  Load balancers are generally grouped into two categories: 
    -   Layer 4 : Layer 4 load balancers act upon data found in network and transport layer 
        protocols (IP, TCP, FTP, UDP). 

    -   Layer 7 load balancers distribute requests based upon data found in application layer 
        protocols such as HTTP.

        Layer 7 load balancers can further distribute requests based on application specific data such as HTTP headers, cookies, or data within the application message itself, such as the value of a specific parameter.


 -  Some industry standard algorithms are:
    -   Round robin
    -   Weighted round robin
    -   Least connections
    -   Least response time / latency
    -   IP Hash â€“ The IP address of the client is used to determine which server 
        receives the request.
    -   URL hash. Much like source IP hash, except hashing is done on the URL of 
        the request. Useful when load balancing in front of proxy caches, as requests 
        for a given object will always go to just one backend cache.
