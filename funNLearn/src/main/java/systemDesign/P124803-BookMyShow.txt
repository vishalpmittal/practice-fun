Solution 1

Functional Requirements / questions to ask:
--------------------------------------------------

-  The system should be able to list down cities where its cinemas are located.
-  Upon selecting the city, the system should display the movies released in that 
particular city to that user.
-  Once the user makes his choice of the movie, the system should display the 
cinemas running that movie and its available shows.
-  The user should be able to select the show from a cinema and book their tickets.
-  The system should be able to show the user the seating arrangement of the cinema hall.
-  The user should be able to select multiple seats according to their choice.
-  The user should be able to distinguish between available seats from the booked ones.
-  Users should be able to put a hold on the seats for 5/10 minutes before they make 
a payment to finalize the booking.
-  The system should serve the tickets First In First Out manner

Non-Functional Requirements:
-------------------------------
-  The system would need to be highly concurrent.
-  The design should be such that system handles such ambiguity fairly.
-  Secure and ACID compliant.

Database Model:
---------------------
-  City
-  Movie
-  Cinema
-  Cinema Hall
-  Show
-  Seat
-  Booking
-  User
-  Payment

Relationships between DB
-----------------------------------
-  A City can have multiple Cinemas.
-  A Cinema can have multiple halls.
-  A Movie can will have many Shows.
-  A Show will have multiple Bookings.
-  A User can have multiple bookings.


handle concurrency
--------------------
-  Utilize transaction isolation levels.

-  SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE; for the seat and booking update. 
As serializable level guarantees safety from Dirty, Non-repeatable and Phantoms reads.
