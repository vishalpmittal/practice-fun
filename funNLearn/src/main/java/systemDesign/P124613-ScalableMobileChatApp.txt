Solution 1
===========
-  maintain a simple mapping of user_id to status.
-  When a user gets online, query each user in the friend list and return the
statuses back to the client (Query will be fast since it is in-memory).

-  When a user changes status, publish the status change to each of his/her
online friends. The list of online friends can be sent via the payload or stored
as a cache in the server if the list is too huge.
