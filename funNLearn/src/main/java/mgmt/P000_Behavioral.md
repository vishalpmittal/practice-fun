Different organizations follow different patters. Some based on YOE some on responsibilities

### Based on Year of experience

- Graduate Engineer
  – until 4 years after graduation
  - normally have limit responsibility and instructed daily by a more experience engineer
- Intermediate Engineer
  – between 2 to 5 years after graduation
  - Independent engineer which moderate guidance from the senior engineers
- Engineer
  - between 5 to 10 years work experience
- Senior Engineer
  - 10+ years of experience
- Principal Engineer
  - 15+ years after graduation from Uni after working on multiple projects

### level according to responsibility

- Engineer
  - responsible to himself and some work, might instruct graduate engineers.
- Senior Engineer
  - responsible of small to medium to projects,
  - might have 2-3 engineers and grads working for him on a project but not directly reporting to him.
- Lead Engineer
  - will be responsible for a discipline on a medium to large project
  - will have engineers from graduates to senior reporting for their work on a project or on site.
- Chief Engineer
  - will be responsible for a team of engineers from grads to leads and might act as a lead engineer on large scale projects.
- Engineer Manager
  - responsible on all projects and will manage the chief and lead engineers.

## Q: Do you describe yourself as a leader or a individual contributor

Leader:
IC:

## Q: What kind of managerial style do you prefer

## Q: Challanges in any project

- identifying the problem statement
- breaking the higher level problem stmt or use case in smaller pieces
- Integration with other application
- cross fucntional and customer co-ordination
- types of deployment (on-prem, service provider, SAAS)
- performace consistency
- keeping it modular application
- Layered agile product

## Q: challanging project you were a part of / challanging project timeline

- SRM
  - S: set of slow APIs
  - T: write new set of APIs on the top of existing ones and improve the performance
  - A: due to the timeline I wrote initial set in multi threaded way, but while writing that I learned the system. And collected stats about each api, underneath layers, middle layer api and unit level apis. Timing and memory usage.
  - R: in the next iteration identified which are the problematic APIs and functions. Which ones need to be re-written/improved. I created a list of API's to keep, to modify and to re-write. That all exercise improved the performance by 30%.

- Vsphere Analytics
  - S: problem statement. underutilization and monitoring of compute resources and time wastage to manage.
  - T: Initiative: improve customer experience for vSphere platform usage and optimization
  - A: Since it was a higher level abstract problem, first I identified and then divided it into three sub-problems
     problems:
      1. what to consider for monitoring
      2. information presentation and notification to customer
      3. automate custom action based on custom rules

     Soltion
      1. Notify customers of abnormal and sluggish activities
      2. provide a dashboard to view the DC at a glance
      3. Rule action engine to perform repetitive tasks
     Challanges: cross team integration, performance impact, modularity.
  - R: ended up implementing three microservices
