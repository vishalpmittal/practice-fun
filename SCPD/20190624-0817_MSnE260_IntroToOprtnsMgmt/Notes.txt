-  Little's Law
   L = Average # of flow units in a process
   W = average process cycle time
   λ = process throughput
   
   At equilibrium 
   L = λ . W
   
   eg:
   100 new masters MSE students / year = λ
   1.5 years to Masters degree = W
   L = 100 * 1.5 = 150 students in MSE masters program

-  Knapsack problem
   suppose a hiker is scaling a hill: what items should he take in his Knapsack?

   Item -> Value -> Weight
   A -> 30 -> 25
   B -> 70 -> 40
   C -> 50 -> 20
   D -> 55 -> 35

   Objective : maximize the value of the contents in the Knapsack
   Constraint: Hiker cannot carry more than 80 lbs in weight

-  Organizations (5 basic functions)
   HR, Finance, R&D, Productions & Operations, Sales/Marketing

-  Organizations Competitive Priorities:
   Cost, Speed, Flexibility, Quality

-  Operations Management (OM)?
   -  OM is the field concerned with the effective planning, scheduling, and
      control of manufacturing and service entities
   -  OM is concerned with managing the production process that converts inputs
      (i.e., material, manpower, capital, information, and energy) into outputs (i.e.,
      goods and services)

-  Probability of getting software with 10 independent modules completed in 16 weeks.
   each success probability is 50%
   1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 .....10 times = 1/(2^10) = 1/1024
   which is less than 1 in 1000 chance that all modules will be converted.

-  Efficiency: output/input
-  Quality: of output
-  Capacity: maximum throughput = output production rate
-  Cycle Time: time elapsed from input to output
-  Flexibility: volume and product
