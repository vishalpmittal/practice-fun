2. Brees Inc., a company that produces and sells a single product, has provided its contribution format income statement for April.
```
Sales (6,200 units).. $136,400 
Variable expenses 80,600 
Contribution margin  55,800 
Fixed expenses  48,700 
Net operating income  7,100 
```
If the company sells 5,800 units, its total contribution margin should be closest to: 
- $55,800
- **$52,200**
- $6,642
- $47,000

Explanation:
- Selling price per unit = Sales ÷ Quantity sold = $136,400 ÷ 6,200 units = $22 per unit
- Variable expenses per unit = Variable expenses ÷ Quantity sold = $80,600 ÷ 6,200 units = $13 per unit
- Unit CM = Selling price per unit - Variable expenses per unit = $22 per unit - $13 per unit = $9 per unit
- Total CM = Unit CM × Quantity sold = $9 per unit × 5,800 units = $52,200

```
Given these data, the unit contribution margin was: 
- $16
- $4
- $2
- **$6**

Explanation:
- Selling price per unit = $256,000 ÷ 16,000 units = $16 per unit

What is the amount of contribution margin if sales volume increases by 30%? 
- $19,500
- $15,000
- **$156,000**
- $120,000

Explanation:
- CM ratio = Contribution margin ÷ Sales = $120,000 ÷ $300,000 = 0.40
- Contribution margin = CM ratio × Sales
- Contribution margin = 0.40 × (1.3 × $300,000) = $156,000

- $98,000

Explanation:
- Selling price per unit = Sales ÷ Quantity sold = $211,200 ÷ 4,400 units = $48 per unit
- Variable expenses per unit = Variable expenses ÷ Quantity sold = $127,600 ÷ 4,400 units = $29 per unit
- Unit CM = Selling price per unit - Variable expenses per unit = $48 per unit - $29 per unit = $19 per unit
- Total CM = Unit CM × Quantity sold = $19 per unit × 4,700 units = $89,300

- 3,872
- 2,320
- 4,834
- **4,462**

Explanation

37.	 Harrison Corporation is studying a project that would have an eight-year life 
    and would require a $300,000 investment in equipment which has no salvage value. 
    The project would provide net operating income each year as follows for the life of the project:

```
Sales                                               $500,000 
Less cash variable expenses                         200,000 
Contribution margin                                 300,000 
Less fixed expenses: 
Fixed cash expenses             150,000 
Depredation expenses            37,500              187,500 
Net operating income                                $112,500 
```
The company's required rate of return is 10%. The payback period for this project is closest to: 
- 3 years
- **2 years**
- 2.5 years
- 2.67 years

Explanation
- Net operating income 112500 - non cash deduction for depreciation 37500 = 150,000
- Payback period = Investment required ÷ Annual net cash inflow = $300,000 ÷ $150,000 per year = 2 years

38.	 Buy-Rite Pharmacy has purchased a small auto for delivering prescriptions. 
    The auto was purchased for $28,000 and will have a 6-year useful life and a $4,000 salvage value. Delivering 
    prescriptions (which the pharmacy has never done before) should increase gross revenues by at least $32,000 per year. 
    The cost of these prescriptions to the pharmacy will be about $25,000 per year. 
    The pharmacy depreciates all assets using the straight-line method. The payback period for the auto is closest to: 

- **4 years**
- 1.8 years
- 2 years
- 1.2 years

Explanation
- Annual net cash inflow = $32,000 - $25,000 = $7,000
- Payback period = Investment required ÷ Annual net cash inflow = $28,000 ÷ $7,000 per year = 4 years

41.	 The management of Helberg Corporation is considering a project that 
    would require an investment of $203,000 and would last for 6 years. The annual net operating income from the

    end of the project would be $23,000. The cash inflows occur evenly throughout the year. 
    The payback period of the project is closest to: 
- **1.5 years**
- 2.0 years
- 1.4 years
- 1.7 years

Payback period = Investment required ÷ Annual net cash inflow = $203,000 ÷ $133,000 per year = 1.5 years

42.	 Neighbors Corporation is considering a project that would require an 
    investment of $279,000 and would last for 8 years. The incremental annual revenues and expenses generated by

The cash inflows occur evenly throughout the year. The payback period of the project is closest to: 
 
- **2.0 years**
- 2.6 years
- 2.5 years
- 1.9 years

Explanation:
- net cash inflow = 106000 + 33000 = 139000 
- Payback period = Investment required ÷ Annual net cash inflow = $279,000 ÷ $139,000 per year = 2.0 years
