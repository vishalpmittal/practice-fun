Instructions for using the source and data files for iTunes project.

These instructions will get you started so that you can have a convenient
method of reading in several iTunes objects ready to use in your
various data structures and algorithms programs.  Once you have the base 
program working, you will not have to repeat these steps - you can reuse
the same program source for all your experiments.

1. If you have not already done so, download the cs_1c package classes and 
   install them into a cs_1c package within your project (as directed by the 
   course web site).


2. Replace the contents of your main Foothill.java file with the sample program
   in Foothill_iTunes.java via copy-paste.  (CAUTION: If Foothill_iTunes.java
   opens up in your IDE environment, don't make the mistake of believing it is
   part of your project.  It is not - you must copy its contents and paste
   into your actual main .java file, which I usually call Foothill.java.)

3. Copy the data file itunes_file.txt into your main project folder.  This is
   higher up than the src folder and is going to be somewhere like:

      your-user-folder/workspace/Foothill. 
   

4. Save, Compile (build) and Run your program.

5. For Eclipse on a Mac, you may have to open itunes_file.txt from the IDE and
   select File -> Convert Line Delimiters To -> Unix [default] before running
   the program.  This only needs to be done once.
